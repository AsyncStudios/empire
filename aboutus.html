                            Home staging is a very important tool in the real estate industry. If done right, a house can be sold up to 4 times faster. Homes staged post-listing sold in an average of 198 days, but those houses that were staged prior to listing sold in 42 days. Most potential home buyers start their property search on the internet and staging your home increases the visibility of your property to potential buyers. It is proven that staging sells houses faster.
                            <p> We are a creative team of two who make the listing process of a salesperson a breeze. We do all the dirty work for you in preparing the house for listing. Our main objective is staging the property using your clients own furniture. We do this by rearranging current furniture placement, removing items and giving design advice from a buyerâ€™s perspective. From staging your property, we also have packages that help in arranging a cleaning crew and professional pictures of the property to upload for your listing.
                                <p> We also have other services, in offering the staging of new properties with no furniture, along with design consultations. This includes, furniture, paint colors, decorative pieces, furniture placement and any other design services you may require. We are able to work with clients one-on-one to create custom packages that best fits your individual needs.
                                    <p> Our current clients consist of sales representatives from Remax, HomeLife Royal LePage.
